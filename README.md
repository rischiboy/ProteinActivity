# Amino Acid Sequence Activity Classification

This project aims to classify aminoacid sequences as active or inactive, focusing on developing effective sequence embeddings, addressing class imbalance, and building a robust predictive model. While the specific context of "activity" is undefined, the methodology emphasizes generalizable solutions for sequence-based classification tasks.

## **Goals**

- Create meaningful embeddings for aminoacid sequences.  
- Address class imbalance using oversampling and weighted loss strategies.  
- Build and evaluate a robust classifier with balanced performance metrics.
